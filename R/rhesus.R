#' Six male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at an age range of 6-19 years (mean = 13.09) living in same-sexual groups
#' of 2 - 4 at the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, German Primate Centre, took part in this study. Monkeys were housed
#' in indoor rooms equipped with a multitude of toys and wooden structures as well as natural and artificial light.
#' The space per monkey exceeded all applicable German and European regulations (Berger et al. 2018). Indoor rooms were
#' temperature-controlled and connected by a tunnel with rooms at ambient outdoor temperature and lighting, but protected
#' from precipitation. On test days, monkeys had free access to water for at least 4 hours
#' (typically much more: for definitions of access to water see (Pfefferle et al. 2018)) and received monkey chow ad libitum.
#' On non-test days, the monkeys had free access to water and received monkey chow ad libitum,
#' supplemented with dried fruits, fresh fruits and vegetables. The health of the monkeys was monitored daily by the
#' animal care staff, veterinarians, and the laboratory researchers who were all highly experienced with these animals.
