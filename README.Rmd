# tiefightR

The goal of tiefightR is to rank commodity positions obtained from preference test experiments.

**Preference tests** are a straightforward approach in asking the appraisal of different goods. To gain a better understanding of the valence of choices made, however, there is a demand for sophisticated tests which allow estimating the strength of the respective preferences. The number of commodities presented at the same time is, however, limited and in classical test settings, usually only two options are presented. Here, we evaluate the option of combining multiple binary choices to rank preferences among a larger number of commodities. In the case of continuous data, ties are introduced when the same amount of commodity (e.g. a fluid) was chosen. The tiefightR package creates a ranking system that takes into account the number of ties and intransitivities in the data. This will help the user to rank specific commodities and evaluate the quality of this ranking.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mytalbot/tiefightR")
```

... or download the source file for easy installation from within R (or RStudio) if you don't have devtools available.


**tiefightR** uses the following package as dependencies (in no particular order). Installing tiefightR will usually take care of this. However, sometimes single dependencies can cause problems and have to be installed manually.

"magrittr", "tibble", "dplyr", "reshape2", "prefmod", "gnm", "ggplot2", "ggpubr", "foreach", "viridis", "Rmisc"

The following function can be used to install single packages - or just the missing ones.

```{r
install.packages("paste missing package name here ")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to compare an item with any combination of the remaining items.

```{r example}
library(tiefightR)
raw        <- tiefightR::human
human_test <- tie_worth(xdata     = raw,
                        showplot  = TRUE,
                        compstudy = "LagreValenceRange_SpringSchool",
                        default   = "War",
                        ordn      = c("Cat", "Crow", "Doctor", "Frustrated", "Lake", "War", "Fire"),
                        r1        = "Lake", # change this
                        r2        = "Cat")  # change this / to multiple combis
```
